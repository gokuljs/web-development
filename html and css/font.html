        During this period, <span>kdkdnvdnkknnnnnn</span> Vuitton began to incorporate leather into most of its products, which ranged from small purses and wallets to larger pieces of luggage. In order to broaden its line, the company revamped its signature
        Monogram Canvas in 1959[10] to make it more supple, allowing it to be used for purses, bags, and wallets. It is believed that in the 1920s, counterfeiting returned as a greater issue to continue on into the 21st century.[6] In 1966, the Papillon
        was launched (a cylindrical bag that is still popular today). By 1977 with annual revenue up to 70 million Francs ($14.27 million US$).[16] A year later, the label opened its first stores in Japan: in Tokyo and Osaka. In 1983, the company joined
        with America's Cup to form the Louis Vuitton Cup, a preliminary competition (known as an eliminatory regatta) for the yacht race. Louis Vuitton later expanded its presence in Asia with the opening of a store in Taipei, Taiwan in 1983 and Seoul,
        South Korea in 1984. In the following year, 1985, the Epi leather line was introduced.[10]
